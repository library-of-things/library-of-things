## Technical Stuff

### Technology/Architecture

**Library of Things** was built with scalability, maintainability, and usability first in mind. Next.js provides a framework over React with powerful server-side rendering and static-site generation functionality that allows us to create a quick, polished experience for the user. Supabase is a managed backend service that allows us to secure user data with Row-level security built into the underlying PostgreSQL database and that provides a robust, auto-generated API based on table schemas. MUI is a feature-rich component library for React based on Google's Material Design.

[Serverless Hosting - Vercel](https://vercel.com/)  
[E2E Testing - Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

### Process and Build-out

By combining these tools along with GitHub repositories, Cypress E2E testing, and Vercel serverless hosting, we were able to quickly iterate over ideas during a one-week sprint.

Our time from initial idea to minimum viable product was approximately 60 total hours, counting breaks. As a fully remote team, we worked both synchronously and asynchronously using tools like Slack, Zoom, GitHub Projects, and Figma to stay connected and up-to-date with the project status.
